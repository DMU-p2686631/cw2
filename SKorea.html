  <h3>Namsan Tower</h3>
    <p>The N Seoul Tower is commonly referred to as Namsan or Seoul Tower. Its height stands at 236meters and is the second-highest point in Seoul. It was built in 1969 to be a radio wave tower, to this day. It is one of the most popular landmarks in Seoul, visible almost from every point in the city (if the sky is clear and there is no smog, which is sadly, very common). The Tower attracts the tourists and locals as a beautiful viewpoint of the city. </p>

  <h3>Electric installations</h3>
    <p>Seoul is divided by several districts. There are several that are very modern, with many skyscrapers. Some have a great history and are full of traditional houses and different buildings. There are also those which have narrow roads with no sidewalks, buildings are almost on top of one another. This kind of electric installation is nothing uncommon in Asia. Though I was surprised to find them in the capital of South Korea.
