<h2 class="columnsh">About analog cameras</h2>
  <p>The pure definition says that an analogue camera is a type of camera that uses film instead of making digital photographs. Most popular are compact cameras and SLRs. But the question is, why would someone go through so many steps and complications just to take pictures? Nowadays you can just simply use your phone. With analogue, you have to buy films, develop them – it costs. Though I think it makes you appreciate it more. Nex thing – anticipation. You cannot ever know how the shots you are taking will turn out and you don’t want to waste more film to do the same shot several times. I think this is the most beautiful part about them. You either love it or hate it, there is no in-between. To feel it, you have to try. Taking your first film to develop it and seeing the results for the first time – I cannot describe the feeling. All my photographs were taken with Olympus 800s and Nikon F75 and I explained my journey with them under the “About me” tab.</p>

  <p class="analogvideop">You can find countless resources and articles about analog cameras, 35mm films, film developing and how to start your journey! There are a lot of passionate people wanting to share their knowledge and preserve it. Fact is that this type of photography gave way to digital one. It is not convenient, films may be expensive, in case your camera breaks in some way, it can be difficult to find someone to fix it. But it is all worth it, I promise. </p>
