  <p class="aboutmetext"> Hello, thank you for visiting my page! My name is Anait and analog photography is one of my many hobbies. I created this page with no purpose of just simply showing my photographs (okay, maybe a little!), but to inspire people. To show them that, although analog photography can mean a lot of effort, it is worth every second of it. And I want to prove to you that there is a big chance that you have a perfectly working camera at your house (or maybe your grandparents?). Olympus 800s was, and still is, my first ever camera. I have found it among my grandpa's things. It was love at first sight! I knew nothing about it, but I wanted to try. I did not know if it was working. I took a risk and bought my first film and did some silly pictures. I couldn’t wait to see it developed and this is how it started! I am no expert, I don’t know much about technical aspects, but that’s okay. I can still love and enjoy it – and so do you. </p>
